# 👐 Set Up Lab

To follow along, you'll need to complete the first two labs of the MongoDB for RDBMS professionals, which will help you in getting:


- A free MongoDB Atlas Cluster
- Sample library data

To get both, open the [intro lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/intro) and follow it (only takes 10-15 mins) to get your database ready. Return here when finished!
