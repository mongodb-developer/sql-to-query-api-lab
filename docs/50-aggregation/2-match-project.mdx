# 👐 $match and $project

MongoDB’s **Aggregation Framework** allows for powerful data transformations and analysis. The **$match**, **$project**, and **$sort** stages are fundamental building blocks of an aggregation pipeline.

---

## **🔹 $match → Filtering data**

Just like `.find()` based on the query mentioned, the `$match` stage filters documents from the collection.

### **Syntax**

```js
{ $match: { <query> } }
```

### Example: Get all the books that were published after the year 2010

```js
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { year: { $gt: 2010 } },
  },
]);
```

:::info
Place `$match` as early as possible in the pipeline to reduce the number of documents processed in later stages.

## **🔹 $project → Selecting fields**

- The `$project` stage controls which fields are included in the output.
- It can also be used for adding computed fields to the results.

### **Syntax**

```js
{
  $project: {
    field1: 1,
    field2: 1,
    _id: 0
  }
}
```

- `1`: Include the field
- `0`: Exclude the field

### Example: Get all the books published after the year 2010. The output should only include the title, year, and page count of the book.

```js
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { year: { $gt: 2010 } },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      title: 1,
      year: 1,
      pages: 1,
      _id: 0,
    },
  },
]);
```

### **Equivalent SQL query**

```sql
SELECT title, year, pages FROM books WHERE year>2010;
```

### **Computed fields example:** Along with the title and authors, also output the count of authors for every book in the database.

```js
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      title: 1,
      authors: 1,
      authorCount: { $size: "$authors" },
    },
  },
]);
```
