# 👐 $lookup (JOINs in MongoDB)

`$lookup` in MongoDB serves a similar purpose to **JOINs** in SQL. It enables combining data from multiple collections by performing an equality match between fields.

## **🔹 Understanding $lookup**

The `$lookup` stage is used to fetch related documents from another collection, similar to `INNER JOIN` or `LEFT JOIN` in SQL.

### **Syntax**

```js
{
  $lookup: {
    from: "<foreign_collection>",  // Collection to join
    localField: "<local_field>",   // Field in current collection
    foreignField: "<foreign_field>", // Field in foreign collection
    as: "<output_array>"             // Output field
  }
}
```

- `from`: The target collection for joining.
- `localField`: The field in the current collection.
- `foreignField`: The field in the target collection.
- `as`: The output field containing the joined data as an array.

## 🔹 Joining 2 collections

### 👐 Example 1: Joining Authors collection with Books

🔍 Get book details along with their authors

```js
db.authors.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "books",
      localField: "books",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "booksWritten",
    },
  },
]);
```

### **Equivalent SQL query**

```sql
SELECT author.* , books_written.*
FROM authors
LEFT OUTER JOIN author_books ON authors.id = author_books.author_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN books as books_written ON author_books.book_id = books_written._id;
```

:::info
The result in MongoDB will have an array (`authorDetails`) instead of flat columns.

## 🔹 Handling unwinding ($unwind)

Since `$lookup` produces an **array**, we can flatten it using `$unwind`.

### Example 2: Get only book titles and single author name

```js
db.authors.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "books",
      localField: "books",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "booksWritten",
    },
  },
  { $unwind: "$booksWritten" },
  { $project: { name: 1, "booksWritten.title": 1, _id: 0 } },
]);
```

:::info
The $lookup operation creates an array within each book document. Using $unwind then flattens this array, resulting in a separate document for every single book-author pair.

## 👐 Challenge

### 👐 1. Fetch books with their associated reviews

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
    ```js
    db.books.aggregate([
      {
        $lookup:
        {
          from: "reviews",
          localField: "_id",
          foreignField: "_id.bookId",
          as: "reviews"
        }
      }
    ]);
    ```
</details>
