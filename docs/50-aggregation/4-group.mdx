# üëê $group

In SQL, the GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country."
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

The `$group` stage in MongoDB‚Äôs Aggregation Framework is equivalent to `GROUP BY` in SQL. It allows us to group documents by a specific field and apply aggregate functions like sum, average, count, min, and max.

## üé¨ How does $group work?

The `$group` stage groups documents based on a field and performs calculations on grouped data.

### **Syntax**

```js
{
  $group: {
    _id: <expression>,
    <field>: { <accumulator>: <expression> }
  }
}
```

- `_id`: The field to group by (use `null` to aggregate all documents together)
- `<accumulator>`: An aggregation operator (`$sum`, `$avg`, `$min`, `$max`, `$push`, `$addToSet`, etc.)

## üëê Example 1: Count the number of books published every year

### **MongoDB query**

```js
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$year",
      totalBooks: { $sum: 1 },
    },
  },
]);
```

### **Equivalent SQL query**

```sql
SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS totalBooks
FROM books
GROUP BY year;
```

### **Sample output**

```json
[
  {"_id": 1980,"totalBooks": 42},
  {"_id": 2000,"totalBooks": 490},
  {"_id": 1981,"totalBooks": 45},
  ...
]
```

---

## üëê Example 2: Without using `$group`, count the number of books published every year

### MongoDB query

```js
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $sortByCount: "$year",
  },
]);
```

### Sample output remains the same as before

```json
[
  {"_id": 1980,"totalBooks": 42},
  {"_id": 2000,"totalBooks": 490},
  {"_id": 1981,"totalBooks": 45},
  ...
]
```

## üëê Example 3: Find the total number of pages published every year.

### **MongoDB query**

```js
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$year",
      totalPages: { $sum: "$pages" },
    },
  },
]);
```

### Equivalent SQL query

```sql
SELECT year, SUM(rating) AS totalPages
FROM books
GROUP BY year;
```

### Sample output

```json
[
  { "_id": 1955, "totalPages": 664 },
  { "_id": 1952, "totalPages": 416 },
  { "_id": 1899, "totalPages": 128 }
  ...
]
```

## üëê Challenge

### üëê 1. Find the average book rating of all books

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
    ```js
    await reviews.aggregate([
      {
        $group: {
          _id: "$_id.bookId",
          avgRating: { $avg: "$rating" }
        }
      }
    ]).toArray();
    ```

</details>

### üëê 2. Find users with the most number of reviews (Hint: use the `name` field in the reviews collection)

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <div>
  There are 2 ways to solve this- 
  - $group with $sort 
  - $sortByCount
  <Tabs groupId="aggregations">
    <TabItem value="$group with $sum + $sort" label="$group with $sum + $sort">
    ```js
    await reviews.aggregate([
      {
        $group: {
          _id: "$name",
          totalReviews: { $sum: 1 },
        },
      },
      {
        $sort: {
          totalReviews: -1,
        },
      },
    ]).toArray();
    ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="sortByCount" label="$sortByCount">
    ```js
    await reviews.aggregate([
      {
        $sortByCount: "$name",
      },
    ]).toArray();
    ```
    </TabItem>

  </Tabs>
  </div>
</details>
