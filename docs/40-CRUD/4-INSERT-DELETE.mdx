# 👐 INSERT → insertOne() & DELETE → deleteOne()

MongoDB provides two methods for inserting documents into a collection:

- `.insertOne()`: Inserts a single document.
- `.insertMany()`: Inserts multiple documents at once.

And just like insert MongoDB provides:

- `.deleteOne()`: Deletes the first matching document.
- `.deleteMany()`: Deletes all matching documents.

## Example: Insert a new review

```js
db.reviews.insertOne({
  text: "Best book I have ever read.",
  rating: 5,
  name: "Jack",
  bookId: "0786222727",
});
```

### Equivalent SQL Query

```sql
INSERT INTO reviews (text, rating, name, bookId)
VALUES ('Best book I have ever read.', 5, 'Jack', '0786222727');
```

## Example: Insert multiple reviews

```js
db.reviews.insertMany([
  {
    text: "Amazing plot.",
    rating: 5,
    name: "John",
    bookId: "0786222727",
  },
  {
    text: "Over-hyped, tbh I feel it's very boring!",
    rating: 2,
    name: "Nick",
    bookId: "0786222727",
  },
]);
```

## Example: Delete one review

```js
db.reviews.deleteOne({
  bookId: "0786222727",
});
```

### Equivalent SQL Query

```sql
DELETE FROM reviews WHERE bookId = '0786222727';
```

## Exercises

- 👐 Insert 4 more reviews for `bookId` "0786222727".
- 👐 Delete all the reviews for `bookId` "0786222727" through a single command.
