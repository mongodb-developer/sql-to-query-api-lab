# 👐 SELECT → projection

In SQL, the `SELECT` statement allows us to specify which columns to retrieve from a table. Similarly, in MongoDB, we use **projection** in the `.find()` method to control which fields to include (or exclude) in query results.

## Syntax

```js
db.collection.find({ <query> }, { <projection> });
```

## **Projection basics**

- By default, MongoDB returns all fields in a document.
- Use projection to **include (1)** or **exclude (0)** specific fields.
- The `_id` field is always included unless explicitly excluded.

## **Example 1: Retrieve only `title` and `authors` fields**

```js
db.books.find({}, { title: 1, authors: 1, _id: 0 });
```

**Equivalent SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT title, authors FROM books;
```

Here:

- `{}` means "match all documents."
- `{ title: 1, authors: 1, _id: 0 }` specifies that only `title` and `authors` should be returned, and `_id` should be excluded.

## **Example 2: Exclude the `reviews` field**

```js
db.books.find({}, { reviews: 0 });
```

**Equivalent SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT title, authors, genres, totalInventory, available FROM books;
```

Here:

- We are removing `reviews`, but all other fields will still appear.

## **Example 3: Using projection along with a query**

```js
db.books.find({ genres: "Science" }, { title: 1, totalInventory: 1, _id: 0 });
```

**Equivalent SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT title, totalInventory FROM books WHERE genres='Science';
```

Here:

- We first **filter** books that belong to the "Science" genre.
- We then **select only** the `title` and `totalInventory` fields.

## **Challenge**

### 👐 1. Retrieve only the `title` field for all books.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <div>
    ```js
      db.books.find({}, {title: 1, _id: 0});
    ```
  </div>
</details>

### 👐 2. Retrieve all fields except `_id` and `authors` for books in the "History" genre.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <div>
    ```js
      db.books.find({genres: "History"}, {_id: 0, authors: 0});
    ```
  </div>
</details>
